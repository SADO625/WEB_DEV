   <h4>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;"> Major capitals in china have suffer major population lost due to the lack-luster 
           behaviour by  major world countries to show support, consideration towards this great nation 
           world capital nations have locked down their capital support systems due to their incapability of
           developing nuclear weapons. 
        </p>
   </h4>

    <h4>
         <p style="color: whitesmoke;">Regional support from other asian countries  such as singapore, haiti, indonesia and other 
           asian countries begin, this may either go both ways for world hearthy countries such as the U.S.A,
           who are futher reluctant to assist their asian counterparts although almost 21.5% of the american population are made of mixed 
           asians. 
         </p>
   </h4>

    <h4>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke">Occurances of these maybe due to the tally given out by the president of china,"Xi Jinping" and his
            reluctancy to sign the bill of irrutable solice or total submission bill to both the U.S and 
            Russia, these bils dont legitimately state that a take over is eminent but within the trieties 
            details it could be seen that most natural resources would be given with partial control.
            <br>
            Other commodities such as life stock and imports would be swung in the concered parties favour
            this gives the idea that most owned resources owned by china would futher be co-owned.
            <br>
            "Xi Jinping" gave no heed to this bill and reserved comments towards this, it may be more to note that 
            the chinese prime-minister, had relations with the U.S.A the previous month, these ended shortly due
            to tensions which arose during this time.
        </p>
   </h4>

   <h4>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> The chinese government is thinking of futher means to an end pr ways to gain aide from
            the worlds governments at this cruical time in their economy and their social arena as a whole 
           china boasts of an eccesive 22.5 billion dollars in income per anum. 
           <br>
           The socialist repubic of china 
           have sighted no intimidation by this actions and ave requested aid from the japanese government, who
           willingly are open to help.
           <br>
           Personally, i belive the chinese government is covered economically and socially this is to me
           a minor set-back which the chinese government would get back from very quickly.
        </p>

   </h4>

   <h4>
         <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> As a capitalist super-power china maybe able to emphize its power most effiecently in the aspect of
         importation of crucial good and services most important to the american republic such as;
          <br>
         - Meat
          <br>
         - vegetables
          <br>
         - Technology such as phones, laptops, smartwatches and other devices
          <br> 
         So in conclusion, the chinese government maybe able to get aid from world powers through economic
         leverage or better still, versitle and impure statements of law, in lay-mans terms this would mean
         Eco-logical warfare or ecoversal blackmail, this futher means the long game between two parties. 
         <br>
         It's  a test a fortitude between three major members of the western and eastern worlds, two colocials verse 
         a monolith of the economic system.
         <br>
          who could stand this only time could tell, reports are expected to be rececived on this matter later in 
           the fourth quater of this year, 2024.
